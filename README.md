# Software for bioactivity research

The repository is being constructed with the intention of providing R-language
software tools which aim to perform at least the services described below.


## Data analysis pipeline

The software here hopes to perform the following steps, described in more detail below.

1.  Binning
2.  Filtering
3.  Compound ranking


#### Binning

Compound data is modified by the Progenesis software.  After this data is binned.


#### Filtering

Scientific knowledge is applied to the data in order to reduce the number of candidate
compounds which are considered in the data analysis.


#### Data analysis

Compounds are ranked by some mechanism such that the highest-ranked compounds are thought
to have the largest effect on bioactivity levels.


## Exploratory tools

1.  Visualizing the bioactivity data
2.  Summaries of the mass spectrometry data
