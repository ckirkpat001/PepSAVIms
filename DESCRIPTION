Description: An implementation of the data processing and data analysis portion of the
    pipeline proposed in Kirkpatrick et al.:  The PepSAVI-MS Pipeline for Natural Product
    Bioactive Peptide Discovery.  In more detail, the package provides a collection of
    software tools used to facilitate the prioritization of putative bioactive compounds
    from a complex biological matrix.  Tools are provided by which to consolidate mass
    spectrometry features in the data believed to belong to the same underlying compounds,
    filter compounds not believed to have an effect on peptide library bioactivity
    quantities, and search for a list of potential candidate compounds with an effect on
    bioactivity.
